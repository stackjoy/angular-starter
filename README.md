## Stackjoy Generators

Run `sj` in a terminal at the root of this codebase to bring up generators for this project

If [Stackjoy](https://www.stackjoy.com) is not installed, in your terminal type in: 

`npm install stackjoy -g`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
